LoBotomy examples
=================

This repository contains bits and pieces of real working implementations for [LoBotomy](https://github.com/akaIDIOT/LoBotomy) clients, called bots.
Check out implementations for your favorite language. If it doesn't exist, interpret this as a hint; feel free to create your own open source bot (framework) and send a pull request to include it here.
